# **Motivation**

The development of Music Matters was driven by a desire to explore and understand the intricacies of media handling on Android. This project served as a learning platform to deepen my knowledge of Jetpack Compose, enabling me to create a fluid and modern user interface. Ultimately, the goal is to leverage this experience to build a robust podcasting app, and Music Matters is a foundational step toward that vision.
