# **Motivation**

The development of Music Matters was driven by a desire to explore and understand the intricacies of media handling on Android. This project served as a learning platform to deepen my knowledge of Jetpack Compose, enabling me to create a fluid and modern user interface. Ultimately, the goal is to leverage this experience to build a robust podcasting app, and Music Matters is a foundational step toward that vision. 

## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 24.
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, utilizing [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous operations.
- Jetpack Libraries:
  - Jetpack Compose: Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for declarative UI development.
  - Lifecycle: Observes Android lifecycles and manages UI states upon lifecycle changes.
  - ViewModel: Manages UI-related data and is lifecycle-aware, ensuring data survival through configuration changes.
  - Navigation: Facilitates screen navigation, complemented by [Hilt Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/libraries#hilt) for dependency injection.
  - Room: Constructs a database with an SQLite abstraction layer for seamless database access.
- Architecture:
  - MVVM Architecture (View - ViewModel - Model): Facilitates separation of concerns and promotes maintainability.
  - Repository Pattern: Acts as a mediator between different data sources and the application's business logic.

- [ksp](https://github.com/google/ksp): Kotlin Symbol Processing API for code generation and analysis.

## **Modularization**

Music Matters adopted modularization strategies below: 
* *Reusability*: Modularizing reusable codes properly enable opportunities for code sharing and limits code accessibility in other modules at the same time.
* *Parallel Building*: Each module can be run in parallel and it reduces the build time.
* *Strict visibility control*: Modules restrict exposing their dedicated from access outside the module.
* *Decentralized focusing*: Each developer team can be assigned their dedicated module.
